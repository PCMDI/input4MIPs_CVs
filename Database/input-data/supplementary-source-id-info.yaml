    A number of bugs were identified in v0.3.0,
    see [https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions/144]().
    As far as we are aware, v0.4.0 fixes all major bugs identified in v0.3.0.
    For the full list of updates since v0.3.0 (and before),
    see [https://github.com/climate-resource/CMIP-GHG-Concentration-Generation/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md]().
    For further analysis of the changes between versions,

    An issue was encountered with the proton ionization data in v4.2.
    It was hence retracted.

    v4.4 uses the final, absolute TSI scale (in consonance with NNL1) which should be used in CMIP7.
    Hence v4.3 is retracted.
    The change between v4.3 and v4.4 results in a 179 ppm increase of TSI and SSI compared to version 4.3.
    The preliminary TSI/SSI version in 4.3 had adapted the TSI scale from the CTIM instrument alone,
    the newer TSI scale is based on a TSIS-1 and CTIM composite (Coddington and Lean, 2024).
    This composite is also consistent with the TSI 'community consensus' composite
    (spot.colorado.edu/~koppg/TSI/TSI_Composite-SIST.txt).

    v4.5 resolves issues with MEE short-term variability.
    Hence v4.4 is retracted.
    There are no changes to SSI/TSI (so, if you have used v4.4 for SSI/TSI, you do not need to restart).

    v1.2.0 includes climatology data (for piControl simulations)
    and updates the handling of small eruptions.
    Hence v1.1.3 is retracted.

    v1.3.0 updates the handling of small eruptions in the pre-satellite era.
    Hence v1.2.0 is retracted.

    v1.3.1 does minor plus updates and adds the aerosol number density requested by some modelling groups.
    Hence v1.3.0 is deprecated.
UOEXETER-CMIP-1-3-1:
  comment_post_publication: >-
    v2.0.0 updates the mean historical SAOD (so the SAOD has decreased a bit, but it is still higher than CMIP6).
    Hence v1.3.1 is deprecated.
