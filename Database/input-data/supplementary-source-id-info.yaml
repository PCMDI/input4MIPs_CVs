    A number of updates have been made in CEDS-CMIP-2025-03-18*.
    These are significantly different from this dataset,
    hence it has been retracted.

    A bug was found in gridding of data for 2022 and 2023.
    This does not affect any other values,
    so this version could still be used for piControl
    and historical simulations if they have already been started.
    If not, we recommend updating to the next version
    for consistency.

    A number of bugs were identified in v0.3.0,
    see [https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions/144]().
    As far as we are aware, v0.4.0 fixes all major bugs identified in v0.3.0.
    For the full list of updates since v0.3.0 (and before),
    see [https://github.com/climate-resource/CMIP-GHG-Concentration-Generation/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md]().

    CR-CMIP-1-0-0 switches to much more conventional naming for gases.
    The affected gases are: c2f6 (previously pfc116), c3f8 (pfc218),
    c4f10 (pfc3110), c5f12 (pfc4112), c6f14 (pfc5114), c7f16 (pfc6116),
    c8f18 (pfc7118), cc4f8 (pfc318) and ch3ccl3 (hcc140a).

    A DOI is now also included in each file.
    Please use it so we can track usage of these files.

    In terms of science, CR-CMIP-1-0-0 updates to the latest ice core and AGAGE data,
    as well as using better data sources for HFC23, CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 than CR-CMIP-0-4-0.
    CR-CMIP-1-0-0 also provides a smoother transition from ice core based records
    to more recent records (i.e. flask and in-situ samples)
    and more sensible pre-industrial values for gases with non-zero pre-industrial concentrations.
    It also uses the Scripps CO2 record to handle the period from 1959 
    to the start of the flask and in-situ samples from other networks.

    The CR-CMIP-1-0-0 dataset also provides much better information
    about the original data sources.

    As a result, CR-CMIP-0-4-0 is deprecated.

    For the full CHANGELOG,
    see
    [here](https://github.com/climate-resource/CMIP-GHG-Concentration-Generation/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

    Differences with CMIP6-1-2: The dataset contains data until December 2022 based on GFED4s Global Fire Emissions.
    Furthermore CO2 has been added as separate species.
    This dataset has been developed for the testing phase of CMIP7.

    DRES-CMIP-BB4CMIP7-2-0 extends the data to 2023.
    Modellers are advised to use DRES-CMIP-BB4CMIP7-2-0.
    Tables for validation of the data of various species, geographical areas and sectors 
    can be found on https://www.geo.vu.nl/~gwerf/GFED/GFED4/tables/ for the 1997 onwards period.

    An issue was encountered with the proton ionization data in v4.2.
    It was hence retracted.

    v4.4 uses the final, absolute TSI scale (in consonance with NNL1) which should be used in CMIP7.
    Hence v4.3 is retracted.
    The change between v4.3 and v4.4 results in a 179 ppm increase of TSI and SSI compared to version 4.3.
    The preliminary TSI/SSI version in 4.3 had adapted the TSI scale from the CTIM instrument alone,
    the newer TSI scale is based on a TSIS-1 and CTIM composite (Coddington and Lean, 2024).
    This composite is also consistent with the TSI 'community consensus' composite
    (spot.colorado.edu/~koppg/TSI/TSI_Composite-SIST.txt).

    v4.5 resolves issues with MEE short-term variability.
    Hence v4.4 is retracted.
    There are no changes to SSI/TSI (so, if you have used v4.4 for SSI/TSI, you do not need to restart).

    This version was retracted
    because the increasing and decreasing labels are backwards.

    v1.2.0 includes climatology data (for piControl simulations)

    v1.3.0 updates the handling of small eruptions in the pre-satellite era.

    v1.3.1 does minor plus updates and adds the aerosol number density requested by some modelling groups.
    Hence v1.3.0 is deprecated.
UOEXETER-CMIP-1-3-1:
  comment_post_publication: >-
    v2.0.0 includes the following key updates:
    i) new H2SO4 number density variable replacing aerosol number density;
    ii) correction to the 1920-1978 ice-core dataset,
    improving consistency with pyrheliometer measurements and CMIP6.
    As a result of this change, the mean historical SAOD has decreased a bit, but it is still higher than CMIP6.
    Hence v1.3.1 is deprecated.

    v3.0 contains a number of spurious spikes post-1950.
    These have been addressed in v3.1.
    As a result, v3.0 has been retracted.

  comment_post_publication: >-
    v3.1 contains an extra variable (crpbf_total) in the land-use management file.
    This is filled with zeroes, so will not affect simulations.
    However, for completeness, we have released an update (v3.1.1)
    which removes this unnecessary variable
    (but using v3.1 is fine if that is what you're doing already).
