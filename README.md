## Acknowledgement

The repository content has been collected from many contributors representing the input datasets for Model Intercomparison Projects (input4MIPs), including those from climate modeling groups and model intercomparison projects (MIPs) worldwide. The structure of content and tools required to maintain it was developed by climate and computer scientists from the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison ([PCMDI](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/)) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ([LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/)), and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project International Project Office ([CMIP-IPO](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-governance/project-office/)), with assistance from a large and expanding international community.

This work is sponsored by the Regional and Global Model Analysis ([RGMA](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/program/regional-global-model-analysis)) program of the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division ([EESSD](https://science.osti.gov/ber/Research/eessd)) in the Office of Biological and Environmental Research ([BER](https://science.osti.gov/ber)) within the Department of Energy's ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov/)) Office of Science ([OS](https://science.osti.gov/)). The work at PCMDI is performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.
