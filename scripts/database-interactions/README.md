# Database handling

This folder contains scripts for working with our database.
They're pretty basic, but they do the job.
The `Makefile` captures the key steps.

In short, make sure you have always run `make venv`
before running any of the other commands.
Run `make help` to see a list of commands and what they do.
It's a very simple `Makefile`, so if the commands aren't working,
just copy them out and run them directly at the command-line.
