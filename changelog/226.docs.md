Update links to point to input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io rather than the now deactivated input4mips-controlled-vocabularies-cvs.readthedocs.io. Note that turning off input4mips-controlled-vocabularies-cvs.readthedocs.io did break the further_info_url value in the volcanic files. Please use the new domain instead.
