- Bumped the recommended ozone source ID to `FZJ-CMIP-ozone-1-2` as `FZJ-CMIP-ozone-1-1` had spurious NaN values
- Bumped the recommend nitrogen deposition source ID to `FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-1` as `FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-0` had files with duplicate tracking IDs (the data is unchanged, so simulations don't have to be restarted but it is better to use `FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-1` if possible)
- Fixed the URL link for `UOEXETER-ScenarioMIP-2-2-1` so it points to "input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io" rather than "input4mips-controlled-vocabularies-cvs.readthedocs.io" which is no longer available
