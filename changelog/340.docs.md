Updated the post-publication comment for CEDS-CMIP-2025-03-18.
Previously we had said that CEDS-CMIP-2025-03-18 was fine for use in CMIP7 piControl and historical simulations.
This is not quite correct, post further investigation (see zenodo.org/records/15127477).
CEDS-CMIP-2025-03-18 differs from the recommended dataset (CEDS-CMIP-2025-04-18) by 0.001% globally and up to factors of 2 in individual grid cells.
If you have started simulations with CEDS-CMIP-2025-03-18,
then please make sure you capture this in reporting and consider updating to use the final, recommended dataset CEDS-CMIP-2025-04-18.
