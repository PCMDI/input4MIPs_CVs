- Updated the contributing docs to better reflect NERSC based workflows, point to the newly added environment file and add in the need to check `docs/dataset-info/delivery-summary.json` when adding a new source ID
- Updated `docs/database-views/input4MIPs_delivery-summary_CMIP6Plus.html` so it is a simple redirect to `docs/database-views/input4MIPs_delivery-summary.html`
