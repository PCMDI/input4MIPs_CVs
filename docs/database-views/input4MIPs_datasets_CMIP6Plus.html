    In terms of science, CR-CMIP-1-0-0 updates to the latest ice core and AGAGE data, as well as using better data sources for HFC23, CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 than CR-CMIP-0-4-0. CR-CMIP-1-0-0 also provides a smoother transition from ice core based records to more recent records (i.e. flask and in-situ samples) and more sensible pre-industrial values for gases with non-zero pre-industrial concentrations. It also uses the Scripps CO2 record to handle the period from 1959  to the start of the flask and in-situ samples from other networks.
    The CR-CMIP-1-0-0 dataset also provides much better information about the original data sources.
    As a result, CR-CMIP-0-4-0 is deprecated.

    In terms of science, CR-CMIP-1-0-0 updates to the latest ice core and AGAGE data, as well as using better data sources for HFC23, CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 than CR-CMIP-0-4-0. CR-CMIP-1-0-0 also provides a smoother transition from ice core based records to more recent records (i.e. flask and in-situ samples) and more sensible pre-industrial values for gases with non-zero pre-industrial concentrations. It also uses the Scripps CO2 record to handle the period from 1959  to the start of the flask and in-situ samples from other networks.
    The CR-CMIP-1-0-0 dataset also provides much better information about the original data sources.
    As a result, CR-CMIP-0-4-0 is deprecated.

    In terms of science, CR-CMIP-1-0-0 updates to the latest ice core and AGAGE data, as well as using better data sources for HFC23, CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 than CR-CMIP-0-4-0. CR-CMIP-1-0-0 also provides a smoother transition from ice core based records to more recent records (i.e. flask and in-situ samples) and more sensible pre-industrial values for gases with non-zero pre-industrial concentrations. It also uses the Scripps CO2 record to handle the period from 1959  to the start of the flask and in-situ samples from other networks.
    The CR-CMIP-1-0-0 dataset also provides much better information about the original data sources.
    As a result, CR-CMIP-0-4-0 is deprecated.

      <td>CR-CMIP-1-0-0 switches to much more conventional naming for gases. The affected gases are: c2f6 (previously pfc116), c3f8 (pfc218), c4f10 (pfc3110), c5f12 (pfc4112), c6f14 (pfc5114), c7f16 (pfc6116), c8f18 (pfc7118), cc4f8 (pfc318) and ch3ccl3 (hcc140a).
    A DOI is now also included in each file. Please use it so we can track usage of these files.
    In terms of science, CR-CMIP-1-0-0 updates to the latest ice core and AGAGE data, as well as using better data sources for HFC23, CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 than CR-CMIP-0-4-0. CR-CMIP-1-0-0 also provides a smoother transition from ice core based records to more recent records (i.e. flask and in-situ samples) and more sensible pre-industrial values for gases with non-zero pre-industrial concentrations. It also uses the Scripps CO2 record to handle the period from 1959  to the start of the flask and in-situ samples from other networks.
    The CR-CMIP-1-0-0 dataset also provides much better information about the original data sources.
    As a result, CR-CMIP-0-4-0 is deprecated.

    In terms of science, CR-CMIP-1-0-0 updates to the latest ice core and AGAGE data, as well as using better data sources for HFC23, CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 than CR-CMIP-0-4-0. CR-CMIP-1-0-0 also provides a smoother transition from ice core based records to more recent records (i.e. flask and in-situ samples) and more sensible pre-industrial values for gases with non-zero pre-industrial concentrations. It also uses the Scripps CO2 record to handle the period from 1959  to the start of the flask and in-situ samples from other networks.
    The CR-CMIP-1-0-0 dataset also provides much better information about the original data sources.
    As a result, CR-CMIP-0-4-0 is deprecated.

    A DOI is now also included in each file. Please use it so we can track usage of these files.
    In terms of science, CR-CMIP-1-0-0 updates to the latest ice core and AGAGE data, as well as using better data sources for HFC23, CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 than CR-CMIP-0-4-0. CR-CMIP-1-0-0 also provides a smoother transition from ice core based records to more recent records (i.e. flask and in-situ samples) and more sensible pre-industrial values for gases with non-zero pre-industrial concentrations. It also uses the Scripps CO2 record to handle the period from 1959  to the start of the flask and in-situ samples from other networks.
    The CR-CMIP-1-0-0 dataset also provides much better information about the original data sources.
    As a result, CR-CMIP-0-4-0 is deprecated.

    In terms of science, CR-CMIP-1-0-0 updates to the latest ice core and AGAGE data, as well as using better data sources for HFC23, CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 than CR-CMIP-0-4-0. CR-CMIP-1-0-0 also provides a smoother transition from ice core based records to more recent records (i.e. flask and in-situ samples) and more sensible pre-industrial values for gases with non-zero pre-industrial concentrations. It also uses the Scripps CO2 record to handle the period from 1959  to the start of the flask and in-situ samples from other networks.
    The CR-CMIP-1-0-0 dataset also provides much better information about the original data sources.
    As a result, CR-CMIP-0-4-0 is deprecated.
