# Usage as a data user

As a data user, the key source of information will be the datasets database.
As discussed in [database views](database-views/index.md),
this provides a record of all the datasets being managed in the input4MIPs project.
You will likely wish to search these records to find the datasets of interest to you,
then use the ESGF links in the tables to download them.

It is unlikely that you will need to use the CVs directly,
although they may be helpful for understanding what the different terms mean
(and this metadata capturing and clarity will improve over time 
as we make greater and greater use of 
[json-ld](https://json-ld.org/)).
