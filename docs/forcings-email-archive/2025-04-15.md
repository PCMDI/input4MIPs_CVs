## IMPORTANT: Errors in Table 1 of Dunne et al, 2025

We are aware that some of you are already following the <a
href="https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3874/"
target="_parent">An evolving Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 7
(CMIP7) and Fast Track in support of future climate assessment</a> preprint
Table 1. Some errors have been found regarding the volcanic and solar forcing
entries, which will be corrected for final submission.

CMIP Panel, WIP and relevant TTs are working on a dynamic format for the
experiment specifications to ensure everyone can access the most up to date
information rather than referring to a static paper going forwards. In the
meantime, for forcings information and descriptions, we strongly recommend
referring to the information/documentation found at <a
href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phases/cmip7/cmip7-forcing-datasets/">https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phases/cmip7/cmip7-forcing-datasets/</a>
