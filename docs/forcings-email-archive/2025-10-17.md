## Request for feedback on Scenario Emission test datasets

The testing data for scenario emissions is now on ESGF and available at [https://input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset-overviews/anthropogenic-slcf-co2-emissions/#scenariomip](https://input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset-overviews/anthropogenic-slcf-co2-emissions/#scenariomip).  

In order to deliver the final product as soon as possible it is important that the team receives any feedback on the data within the next 1-2 weeks. A Github issue has been set up at [https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions/386](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions/386) to signpost the data and gather feedback from you all.
 
Based on this feedback, the team will revise the data as much as needed to deliver a final product before the end of October. Feedback received after this time will not be integrated into the final product.
