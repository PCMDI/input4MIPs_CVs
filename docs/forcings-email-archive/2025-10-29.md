## CMIP7 scenarios update and forcings development

**Scenarios update**
Responding to comments received during open community review of van Vuuren et al (2025) the ScenarioMIP Scientific Steering Committee and Advisory Group have updated some of the CMIP7 scenario names. Very Low Low Overshoot (VLLO) becomes Very Low (VL) and Very Low High Overshoot (VLHO) becomes Low to Negative (LN).  A High-Low (HL) scenario that follows the high scenario until rapid mitigation begins around 2050 has also been added. An updated version of [van Vuuren et al (2025)](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2025/egusphere-2024-3765/) is expected to be available very soon.

**CMIP7 Scenario forcing development**
A number of preliminary scenario forcing datasets have already been made available via ESGF (see here for more information and links to the data) and are ready for testing by any interested modelling centres or data analysts. We encourage users to test the available datasets and provide feedback via input4MIPs Github discussions as soon as possible to refine the final scenario forcing development.

A small number of the scenario forcings (land use, ozone and nitrogen deposition) cannot produce all seven scenarios at the same time. Therefore, a scenario running order has been developed in close collaboration with ScenarioMIP and downstream activities such as ISIMIP, ISMIP7 and CORDEX, who require scenario data by July 2026 to facilitate their contribution to AR7. As outlined in Dunne et al. (2025) the CMIP Panel strongly encourages modelling centres to follow a running order, first running the  H and VL scenario simulations, for which scenario forcings will be delivered by January 2026. Within the survey, accompanying this update, we are requesting feedback to support further guidance on the running order of the remaining scenarios up to 2100 and extensions out to 2300/2500.

Scenario             | Scenario extension | Based on SSP
-------------------- | ------------------ | ------------
High (H)*            | H-ext              | SSP3
Very Low (VL)*       | VL-ext             | SSP1
High Low (HL)        | HL-ext             | SSP5
Medium (M)           | M-ext              | SSP2
Medium Low (ML)      | ML-ext             | SSP2
Low (L)              | L-ext              | SSP2
Low to Negative (LN) | LN-ext             | SSP2



**Note:** H and VL will be made available first to allow the
 chemistry-climate models to be initiated.
