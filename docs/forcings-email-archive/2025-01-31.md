## Update on CMIP6Plus stratospheric aerosol optical property and volcanic sulfur emission datasets

Version 1.3.0 of the CMIP6Plus stratospheric aerosol optical property and volcanic sulfur emission datasets are now [available on ESGF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1blX5kv0We1BteqWzMKs0OuhazAcAonay/edit) with succinct documentation [available here](https://input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset-overviews/stratospheric-volcanic-so2-emissions-aod/#cmip7). A key development in this version is the addition of small-magnitude volcanic eruption pre-satellite era, addressing an important bias in previous versions. This development means that the piControl climatology for stratospheric aerosol optical properties should be very stable from now on, and that if you start spinning up your model with this version, we expect minor effects when you implement future updates, including the final version that will be frozen for use in the AR7 Fast Track at the end of February. We encourage users to test the available datasets and provide feedback via the input4MIPs_CVs repository discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions).
