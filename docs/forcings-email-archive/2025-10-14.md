Please continue to ask questions and engage in discussions at the [input4MIPs Github discussions](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions) and find all information relevant to CMIP7 Forcing datasets at https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phases/cmip7/cmip7-forcing-datasets/

The TT is now working hard on delivering draft and final versions of the scenario forcings and will keep you regularly updated on the progress.
