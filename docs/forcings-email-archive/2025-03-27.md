# 2025-03-27 update

The [CMIP Forcings Task Team](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip7-task-teams/forcings/) would like to provide an update on the availability of CMIP7 forcings datasets:

- CMIP7 Anthropogenic short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) and CO2 emissions data is now [available](https://input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset-overviews/anthropogenic-slcf-co2-emissions/#cmip7). 
- For models with interactive chemistry, all data sets required for piControl and historical simulations are now available.
- For models that require ozone and nitrogen deposition as inputs, we expect ozone and nitrogen deposition piControl datasets to be available before the end of April.
- Please see [https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phases/cmip7/cmip7-forcing-datasets/](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phases/cmip7/cmip7-forcing-datasets/) for links to the data, where and how to feedback, and how to ensure you stay updated on the latest announcements.
