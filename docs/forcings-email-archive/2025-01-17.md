## **Historical forcings**

_CMIP7 datasets for AR7 Fast Track_

The CMIP Forcings Task Team have been working exceptionally hard and anticipate all piControl and historical CMIP7 DECK forcing datasets to be available for use by 28th February 2025, except for the historical ozone concentrations and nitrogen deposition datasets, which are expected in May 2025. 

_CMIP6Plus testing datasets_

A number of CMIP6Plus preliminary forcing datasets have already been made [available](https://input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database-views/input4MIPs_delivery-summary_CMIP6Plus.html) via ESGF through the [input4MIPs project](https://esgf-node.ornl.gov/search/input4MIPs) and are ready for testing by any interested modelling centres or data analysts. We encourage users to test the [available datasets](https://input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database-views/input4MIPs_delivery-summary_CMIP6Plus.html) and provide feedback via the input4MIPs_CVs repository discussions on [GitHub (https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions)](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions).

For further details on the CMIP DECK forcing suite please see the [CMIP Forcings Task Team webpage](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip7-task-teams/forcings/), the recent open community drop-in session [slides](https://wcrp-cmip.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-29_Forcings-drop-in_session.pdf) and [recording](https://esait.webex.com/esait/ldr.php?RCID=19a0cdb6fd9d5ada593958dfb1a9daf2), and the input4MIPs documentation repository (https://input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset-overviews/) 

**PLEASE NOTE:** All CMIP6Plus era data sets are for testing purposes only, i.e. they are not to be relied upon for CMIP7 production runs. 

## **Scenarios and harmonisation**

We anticipate some scenario forcings datasets may be available for testing as early as April 2025 with others expected by October 2025. With the ScenarioMIP description manuscript now out for review, we anticipate final scenario forcing datasets to be available once the ScenarioMIP team has finalized the protocol and the participating socioeconomic modelling teams (i.e. Integrated Assessment Models, or IAMs) have produced scenarios in line with this protocol. The Forcings Task Team is working on establishing a firmer timeline for the scenario forcing delivery and is at the final stages of planning for the harmonisation, which is part of providing scenario forcings.
