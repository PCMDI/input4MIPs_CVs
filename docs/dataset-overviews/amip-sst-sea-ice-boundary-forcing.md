# AMIP sea-surface temperature and sea-ice boundary forcing

## Summary

**All of the text below is a draft written by a non-expert to get things moving.**
**Please do not put any faith in its accuracy.**

Multiple versions of the AMIP boundary conditions are
[available on the ESGF](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search?project=input4MIPs&versionType=all&activeFacets=%7B%22source_id%22%3A%22PCMDI-AMIP-1-1-9%22%7D).
There has been a significant change in the input datasets,
so future versions will likely be significantly different from the versions published to date.

## Navigating the data
