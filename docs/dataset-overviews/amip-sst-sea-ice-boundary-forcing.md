### Source IDs for CMIP phases

The source ID that identifies the dataset to use in CMIP7 is given below.

#### CMIP7

No data available for this phase yet.

Once the v2.0.x dataset is generated, we anticipate regular 6-monthly updates capturing temporal extensions
will be made available through input4MIPs (just like was done with the v1.1.0 through v1.1.8 versions in CMIP6).

The `mip_era` metadata value of 'CMIP7', is contained in the netcdf file global attributes, and is also
a `Target MIP List` search facet within the ESGF input4MIPs project page [here](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search/input4MIPs)

If you find a problem related to this dataset, please
[create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/issues/new?template=data_issue.md)
so that the identification and resolution of the problem is publicly accessible.

If you have a question related to this dataset, please
[create a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions)
so that the identification and resolution of the problem is publicly accessible.

## Navigating the data

### Recommendation for pre-industrial control (piControl)

This data is only used for the DECK AMIP experiment (CMIP:amip). As it is not used for the piControl
experiment hence there is no recommendation.
