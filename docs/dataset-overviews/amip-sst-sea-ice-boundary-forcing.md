## Summary

Multiple versions of the AMIP boundary conditions are
[available on the ESGF](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search?project=input4MIPs&versionType=all&activeFacets=%7B%22source_id%22%3A%22PCMDI-AMIP-1-1-9%22%7D).
There has been a significant change in the input datasets,
so future versions will likely be significantly different from the versions published to date.

## Navigating the data

### Uncertainty

## Differences from CMIP6 or other previous versions

### File formats and naming

No changes, same conventions as was used in CMIP6.

### Data
