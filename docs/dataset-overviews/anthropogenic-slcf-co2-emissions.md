### Source IDs for CMIP7 phases

The source ID that identifies the dataset to use in the different phases of CMIP7 is given below.

#### Testing

For the testing of CMIP7, use data with the source ID [CEDS-CMIP-2024-10-21](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search?project=input4MIPs&versionType=all&&activeFacets=%7B%22source_id%22%3A%22CEDS-CMIP-2024-10-21%22%7D)

This data is for testing purposes only.
Production simulations should not be started based on this data.
(As a further bit of context, you can tell that this is testing data because it has a `mip_era` metadata value of 'CMIP6Plus'.
This metadata value appears both in the file's global metadata as well as its metadata on ESGF.)

If you have any feedback, please add it to the [relevant GitHub discussion](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions).

#### CMIP7 AR7 fast track

No data available for this phase yet.

This data will be for the CMIP7 AR7 fast track.
All data sets for use in the fast track will be published with a `mip_era` metadata value of 'CMIP7'.
This metadata value will appear both in the file's global metadata as well as its metadata on ESGF.

Further details will follow in early 2025.

#### CMIP7

No data available for this phase yet.

This data will be for CMIP7.
All data sets for use in CMIP7 will be published with a `mip_era` metadata value of 'CMIP7'.
This metadata value will appear both in the file's global metadata as well as its metadata on ESGF.

Further details will follow after the fast track is underway
(including details about how updates to this data will be handled over the lifetime of CMIP7).
