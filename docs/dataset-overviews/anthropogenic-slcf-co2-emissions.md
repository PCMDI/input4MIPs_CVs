# Anthropogenic short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

## Summary

**All of the text below is a draft written by a non-expert to get things moving.**
**Please do not put any faith in its accuracy.**

A first version of the datasets will be released on the ESGF by November 8 2024.
Full details on the dataset and all relevant links can be found
on the [CEDS GitHub page](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS).

## Navigating the data

### Recommendation for pre-industrial control

Repeat the 1850 values.

### Grids and frequencies provided

Data is provided on a 2-degree grid.
A 0.5-degree grid is in preparation.
All data is provided on a monthly timestep (i.e. includes seasonality).

### Variables provided

Grids provides estimates of emissions for 
BC, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, NMVOC, NO<sub>x</sub>, OC and SO<sub>2</sub>.
[Add info about the supplementary data.]

### Uncertainty

At present, uncertainties are not quantified.
Uncertainties in the recent years are higher
(due to delays in reporting from input sources).
Uncertainties far back in time are also higher.
In between (roughly between 1970 and 5 years before now)
the uncertainties are smaller.
The uncertainties are likely significant 
and would propagate into notable uncertainties in radiative forcing.

### Examples of working with the data

See the [CEDS GitHub page](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS).
The [harmonisation team's notebooks](https://github.com/iiasa/emissions_harmonization_historical/)
may also be of interest.

## Differences from CMIP6

### File formats and naming

The file formats are identical to CMIP6.
The naming is, as far as we are aware, the same as CMIP6 too.

### Data

CEDS provides extensive analysis of changes in data between versions.
