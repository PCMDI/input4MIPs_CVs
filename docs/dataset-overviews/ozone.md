### Source IDs for CMIP7 phases

The source ID that identifies the dataset to use in CMIP7 is given below.

#### CMIP7

For the CMIP7 phase of CMIP7, use data with the source ID [FZJ-CMIP-ozone-1-0](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search?project=input4MIPs&versionType=all&&activeFacets=%7B%22source_id%22%3A%5B%22FZJ-CMIP-ozone-1-0%22%5D%7D)

No DOIs are available for this data.

This data is for use in CMIP7 production simulations.
All data sets for use in CMIP7 production simulations are published with a `mip_era` metadata value of 'CMIP7'.
This metadata value appears both in the file's global metadata as well as its metadata on ESGF.

If you find an issue, please
[create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/issues/new?template=data_issue.md)
