## Summary

A first version of the stratospheric volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions
and aerosol optical properties is
[available on the ESGF](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search?project=input4MIPs&versionType=all&activeFacets=%7B%22source_id%22%3A%22UOEXETER-CMIP-1-1-3%22%7D).
We are collecting bugs in [this discussion](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions/142).
If you find any other issues, please add them to
[the discussion](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions/142).

## Navigating the data

### Recommendation for pre-industrial control

This is an open discussion and not yet settled.

### Grids and frequencies provided

The volcanic emissions are provided with daily resolution
alongside latitude, longitude and injection height information.

The aerosol optical properties are provided with monthly resolution
on a latitudinal grid.

### Variables provided

The mass of SO<sub>2</sub> associated with eruptions of different volcanoes is provided.

Alongside the emissions information, aerosol optical properties are also provided.
For example, extinction coeffecients and aerosol optical depth.

### Uncertainty

There is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of eruptions,
particularly before the satellite era.
This uncertainty is not reported in the data, but could be in future.
The uncertainty in the magnitude of eruptions is still relatively large,
even in surface temperature terms,
where it could be up to 20% of the anthropogenic warming (so roughly around 0.2K).

### Examples of working with the data

[TBD]

## Differences from CMIP6 or other previous versions

### File formats and naming

The file formats are quite different from CMIP6 
because the data is coming from a different provider.
The naming may also be different.
Overall, we would say that the data is more uniform now
and in line with other input4MIPs data and conventions.

### Data

[TBD: find the links that analyse the differences, 
ideally including the volcanic SO2 emissions used by some groups 
(even though there was no CMIP6 recommendation)]
