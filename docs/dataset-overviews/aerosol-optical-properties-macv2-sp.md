## Summary

A first version of the aerosol optical properties will be released in the coming months.
The methods used for producing this data are stable 
(see [Stevens et al., 2017](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/433/2017/)).
However, the data is entirely dependent on the emissions
(both biomass burning and anthropogenic),
so this dataset can only be considered stable once the short-lived emissions are stable.

## Navigating the data

### Recommendation for pre-industrial control

Use the same approach as is used for anthropogenic emissions.

### Grids and frequencies provided

The aerosol optical properties provides scaling factors/parameters 
to calculate aerosol plumes associated with aerosol emissions
for models that do not calculate this themselves.
The provided data is only parameters.
As a data user, you have to calculate gridded data/input yourself using [TBD].

### Variables provided

Two variables can be calculated from the data:

1. aerosol optical properties
1. an adjustment to cloud-droplet population densities

### Uncertainty

[TBD, recommendations on parameter ranges?]

## Differences from CMIP6

### File formats and naming

[TBD once we have finalised the format]

### Data

The data itself follows the same method as CMIP6,
hence any changes are due to changes in the inputs alone.
