### Source IDs for CMIP7 phases

The source ID that identifies the dataset to use in CMIP7 is given below.

#### DECK

##### CMIP7

For the DECK simulations in the production phase of CMIP7, use data with the source ID [FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-2](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search?project=input4MIPs&versionType=all&activeFacets=%7B%22source_id%22%3A%22FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-2%22%7D)

The data has the DOI: [10.25981/ESGF.input4MIPs.CMIP7/2584172](https://doi.org/10.25981/ESGF.input4MIPs.CMIP7/2584172).

This data is for use in CMIP7 production simulations.
All data sets for use in CMIP7 production simulations are published with a `mip_era` metadata value of 'CMIP7'.
This metadata value appears both in the file's global metadata as well as its metadata on ESGF.

If you find an issue, please
[create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/issues/new?template=data_issue.md)
so that the identification and resolution of this issue is publicly accessible.

##### Testing

## Navigating the data

### Recommendation for pre-industrial control

For pre-industrial control, please use the monthly climatology files (frequency value of `monC`).
Simply apply this forcing on repeat.

## Differences in format from CMIP6 or other previous versions

The data format is currently very similar, if not the same as CMIP6
(e.g. variable names are the same, dimensions are the same).
The only change is that we have cleaned up the format
to make it as close to being CF-compliant as possible.

## Revision history

### FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-1

There were faulty N-deposition values in the 1930s across variables and the variable wetNOy was 50%
too high in both the PI and historical forcing fields due to double-counting of some wetNOy
components. They were hence retracted. If you have started simulations with FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-1,
please restart them with the updated FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-2 data. The original issue that identified
this is <a href="https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/issues/385">here</a>

### FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-0

Multiple files shared the same tracking ID. They were hence retracted. This is fixed in
FZJ-CMIP-nitrogen-1-1. However, the data is unchanged so simulations do not need to be restarted.
