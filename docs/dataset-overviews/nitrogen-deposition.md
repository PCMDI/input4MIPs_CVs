### Source IDs for CMIP7 phases

The source ID that identifies the dataset to use in the different phases of CMIP7 is given below.

#### CMIP7

No data available for this phase yet.

This data is for use in CMIP7 production simulations.
All data sets for use in CMIP7 production simulations are published with a `mip_era` metadata value of 'CMIP7'.
This metadata value appears both in the file's global metadata as well as its metadata on ESGF.

If you find an issue, please
[create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/issues/new?template=data_issue.md)
so that the identification and resolution of this issue is publicly accessible.

#### Testing

No data available for this phase yet.

This data is for testing (both of the forcing data and of modelling workflows) only.
Production simulations should not be started based on any data that has a `mip_era` value equal to 'CMIP6Plus'.
(The `mip_era` metadata value appears both in each file's global attributes as well as its metadata on ESGF.)

If you have any feedback, please add it to the [relevant GitHub discussion](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/discussions).
