# Dataset overviews

Here we provide an overview of the datasets provided within input4MIPs.
These overviews do not replace or duplicate the papers and documentation provided by the dataset providers elsewhere.
Instead, they are intended to supplement these sources of information
with information that is targeted at users of input4MIPs data
(who can be very different from users who get this data via other means),
in particular models participating in [CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip).
