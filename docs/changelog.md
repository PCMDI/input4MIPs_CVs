# Changelog

The version number takes the form X.Y.Z, but does not completely follow semantic versioning.
The major number, X, is the CMIP generation we are targeting.
At the moment, this is 6, soon (hopefully Jan 2025) it will be 7.
The minor number, Y, is incremented for breaking changes to the CVs.
The patch number, Z, is incremented for all other changes.

Backward incompatible (breaking) changes will only be introduced in major or minor versions.

## input4MIPs CVs v6.5.22 (2024-10-18)


### üìö Improved Documentation

- - Added a placeholder for population inputs.
  - Increased the default number of entries shown on the table views to 25 to accomodate the new dataset.

  ([#132](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/132))
- - Updated DRES-CMIP-BB4CMIP7-1-0 dataset status.
  - Added scripts/pmount-database-generation/db-add-tree-bb-workaround.sh to deal with <variable_id> format inconsistency for 4 DRES datasets.

  ([#134](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/134))

### üîß Trivial/Internal Changes

- [#129](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/129), [#130](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/130), [#131](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/131)


## input4MIPs CVs v6.5.21 (2024-10-04)


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- Re-named the ESGF scrape from `Database/input-data/esgf.json` to `Database/input-data/esgf-input4MIPs.json`. ([#113](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/113))

### üÜï Features

- Added the UOEXETER-CMIP-1-1-2 source ID. ([#117](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/117))

### üìö Improved Documentation

- Moved most of the `README`'s content into the docs.
  This helps avoid broken links in future,
  because links don't always play nice with GitHub's homepage rendering. ([#109](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/109))
- Added a delivery summary view to our docs.
  This provides information about when different datasets are expected to be delivered. ([#111](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/111))
- Update the delivery status view of the datasets. ([#119](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/119))
- Updated the status of dataset publication. ([#126](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/126))

  Note that this fix appears in the database only.
  The underlying file entries in `Database/input-data/pmount` still reflect the files as they appear on disk. ([#94](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/94))

  Also made the "latest" column more obvious in our database views.
  Also tried to use "input4MIPs" rather than "Input4MIPs" throughout. ([#95](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/95))
- Add Read the Docs build of the docs. ([#105](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/pull/105))
