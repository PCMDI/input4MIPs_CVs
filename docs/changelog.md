# Changelog

The version number takes the form X.Y.Z, but does not completely follow semantic versioning.
The major number, X, is the CMIP generation we are targeting.
At the moment, this is 6, soon (hopefully Jan 2025) it will be 7.
The minor number, Y, is incremented for breaking changes to the CVs.
The patch number, Z, is incremented for all other changes.

Backward incompatible (breaking) changes will only be introduced in major or minor versions.
